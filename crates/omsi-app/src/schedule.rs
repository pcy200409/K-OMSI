//! Scheduled AI buses: the map's timetable lines (`TTData`) put buses on their tracks at the
//! tour departure times; they follow the track lanes and stop at the trip's stations.
//!
//! The timetable itself is omsi-sim's `timetable_run` (`ScheduleSim`: the departures and
//! which are due, the tours' vehicles, the routes on the lanes, the departure boards; the
//! trip times, the IBIS, the player's duty), which does not touch the GPU. `Schedule` holds
//! it (`Deref` to `ScheduleSim`) with what the GPU needs: `fleet` reads and uploads the
//! vehicles ahead, `dispatch` and `spawn` put the buses on the road and take them off.
