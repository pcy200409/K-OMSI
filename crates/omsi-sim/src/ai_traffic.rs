//! AI road traffic, the simulation: vehicles from `ailists.cfg` moving on the map's path
//! network (`crate::traffic`), the traffic light programs of the junctions, the cars out of
//! range, and who may appear where the player looks.
//!
//! Nothing here knows of the GPU, the window or the loaded world: what the cars look like
//! and sound like, and taking the lanes and the vehicle types from the world, is omsi-app's
//! `traffic` (its `Traffic` is a `TrafficSim` with its pictures and sounds).
